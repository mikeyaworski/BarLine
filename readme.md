# Bar Line

In this repo, there are native Android & iOS apps and a PHP REST API to display the wait time and crowding levels of bars and night clubs. There is also support to display custom ads for specific locations. The data is required to be updated by staff using a password. This is an example app and therefore the data is only placeholder. The data is stored in a MySQL database.

## Testing

The API used in the Android & iOS code will show demo data. To edit data, the password `grandson66` can be used for Phils Grandsons under Kitchener/Waterloo.
